== GeoZarr format requirements

TIP: This is a very preliminary draft. The content is essentially for showing the purpose of the proposed sections, but the focus should be on the table of contents.

A GeoZarr data format is a regular Zarr hierarchy that represents geospatial coverages such as granules, scenes series, mosaics or any spatio temporal asset (as per STAC specification).

=== Overview and Definitions 

The OGC Abstract Topic 6 [OGC 07-011] standard defines all geographic object as a feature, and a coverage is one special kind of feature which stands for any digital geospatial information representing space and time varying phenomena. The ISO 19123 standard provides a formal definition for coverages: a feature acting as a function that returns values from its range for any direct position within its spatiotemporal domain” . 

GeoZarr, like many array-oriented geospatial data formats (e.g., NetCDF, GeoTIFF), primarily supports *Rectified Grid Coverages*. Rectified Grid Coverage is primarily used in geospatial data and geographic information systems (GIS). It is a type of grid coverage that aligns with a coordinate reference system, ensuring that each cell or grid point corresponds precisely to a specific geographic location. 

The base terminology in the scope of this specification includes the following terms:
- A *GeoZarr Instance* (or GeoZarr) is a hierarchy of objects including attributes and arrays describing geospatial information
- A *GeoZarr Data Variable* is the arrray and attributes that define the values of a *Rectified Grid Coverage*
- A *GeoZarr Coordinate Variable* is the array (might be empty) and attributes  that define a coordinate dimension of a Rectified Grid Coverage
- A *GeoZarr Auxiliary Variable* is the array (might be empty) and attributes that define other type of information
- A *GeoZarr Gridded Dataset* (or Dataset) is a set of GeoZarr Variables which define one or more Rectivfed Grid Coverages (thus including their values, coordinates and ancillary data and metadata).

A Dataset (referenced as an asset in a STAC item) facilitates the disocovery and handling of the coverages by clients, such as web maps, and supports advanced capabilities such as pyramiding. However,GeoZarr also flexible and adaptable enough to accommodate other types of information: the specification aim to ensure that a transformation to GeoZarr from a source format can be reverted back to the original format.

=== Underlying GeoZarr Requirements

This section addresses the core GeoZarr Requirements Class applicable to all GeoZarr instances.

==== Requirement Class GeoZarr

TIP: This section should define the requirements for a Zarr 'instance' (a hierarchy).

The base requirement class is designed to be flexible, facilitating conversion from any data source. Most source datasets might be encoded in GeoZarr, and additional conformance classes define specific types of assets in GeoZarr to facilitate standard interpretation by clients.

A GeoZarr instance must:
- Consist of any Zarr tree structure.
- Have a root that is always a Zarr group.
- Include the property `conformsTo` in the root group, set to the GeoZarr requirement class.
- Allow any number of levels in the hierarchy of groups.


===== Variables

A variable represent an array of values of the same type in Zarr arrays. A variable can describe the values of a coverage, their coordinates, or any auxiliary data (any value or array of values describing information useful complementing the coverage variables). Those different types of varaibles are defined further in the specification.

===== Attributes

TIP: Define how (where) is encoded the metadata

GeoZarr attributes are used to store ancillary data or metadata at any level of the hierarchy. The informaiton might be about the variables, the coordinates, the spatio-temporal asset, or any purpose.

===== Gridded Dataset Overview

GeoZarr defines flexible conventions that allow encoding most content from any source format. This includes any information that can be expressed as a property or JSON object, geospatial arrays (raster) or non-geospatial arrays, and the entire hierarchical structure in groups.

A generic geospatial data client (such as a mapping tool) may not be able to utilize all specific information of a given format. GeoZarr places special emphasis on Gridded Dataset which might be discovered, interpreted and displayed on a map. Gridded Dataset which refers to a structured format of spatial data represented as a matrix of cells or pixels, organized in a regular grid. Each cell holds a value representing a specific geographic area. Gridded Datasets includes 2D Rasters, Raster Time Series, Geo-Datacubes (with dimensions like time, light spectrum, altitude, etc.)

A GeoZarr Gridded Dataset, or simply Dataset, consists of data variables sharing the same coordinates, and some attributes which together form a self describing dataset and represent a geospatial phenomenon in the data hierarchy.  GeoZarr defines the structure and necessary metadata for understanding this dataset, such as an index of available variables, the projection used, and the coordinates describing the dimensions of these variables.

**GeoZarr Gridded Dataset Abstract Representation**

===== Gridded Dataset Structure

A GeoZarr may include Dataset Groups which consists in n-D variables observed by a sensor (temperature, humidity, elevation). These variables are defined by geospatial coordinates and optional extra dimensions (time, altitude, etc.).

|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/req/geozarr-dataset/group
| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | A Gridded Dataset must be stored as a Zarr group {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
| B {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | The Dataset must include children Zarr arrays for each data variable and for each coordinate {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
| C {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | The Dataset group must include the property `conformsTo` set to the Dataset requirement class  {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
| D {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | TBD {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/req/geozarr-dataset/group
| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | A Gridded Dataset must be represented by a Zarr group.
| B {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | The Zarr group must include the property `conformsTo` set to the Dataset requirement class.
| C {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | Coordinates, attributes, and any additional information must be represented in the Zarr group or children Zarr objects (see furhter equirements)
|===

NOTE: We may require or recommend that a Dataset is restricted to a single data variable or to variable with consistent coordinates (otherwise the group is a mess). We might specify also a property for a index of variables.


===== Data Variables

TIP: Defines the requirements for the variables in a dataset (how to specify dimensions and relationship with the coordinates sibling)

A Data Variable holds the data values of the observed geospatial phenomena. A variable has a name, type,any dimension, attributes and values.

TBD: can/should a data variable have dimensions which are not coordinates

[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/req/geozarr-dataset/data-variable
| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | Each data variable (values of a rectified grid coverage) must be stored as a child Zarr array within the dataset group.
| B {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | The child Zarr array must include the attribute `_ARRAY_DIMENSIONS` which lists the dimension names.
| C {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | For each dimension listed in `_ARRAY_DIMENSIONS`, there must be a corresponding coordinate variable in the dataset group.
|===

Each data variable must:
- Be stored as a child Zarr array within the dataset group.
- Include the attribute `_ARRAY_DIMENSIONS` listing the dimension names.
- Have a corresponding coordinate variable for each dimension listed in `_ARRAY_DIMENSIONS` within the dataset group.


===== Coordinates

TIP: Defines the requirement for the data coordinates and reference to the requirement classes for the different encoding of data coordinate.

[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/req/geozarr-dataset/coordinate-variable
| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | Each coordinate variable (representing the positions of one dimension of a data variable) must be represented in a child Zarr array within the dataset group.
| B {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | The Zarr array variables must be named with the same name as the dimension of the data variable they represent.
|===

Each coordinate variable must:
- Be represented in a child Zarr array within the dataset group.
- Be named with the same name as the dimension of the data variable it represents.

[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/rec/geozarr-dataset/coordinate-variable
| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | Each coordinate variable must include the Climate and Forecast (CF) standard name in the `standard_name` attribute of the Zarr array.
|===

Each coordinate variable should:
- Include the Climate and Forecast (CF) standard name in the `standard_name` attribute of the Zarr array.


=== Coordinate

TIP: describe the types and encoding of different types of coordinate

==== Coordinate Types

TIP: Defines what are the requirement in GeoZarr related to latitude, longitude, time, etc. metadata such as does it impose to use CF standard names for qualifying the coordinate (or another convention from GDAL)

==== Coordinate Encodings

TIP: Which encoding does it support (do we impose/recommend to always have 2D array ?).

Proposed encoding:
- 2D array (the nominal encoding applied by xarray)
- origin/offset:
- COARDS :

==== Coordinates Reference System Encodings

TIP: any consideration with projections and affine transformations ?



=== Tiling and Pyramiding

TIP: equivalent to GeoTiff (https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-026/21-026.html). GeoZarr should specify if and how tiling might be applied for three-dimensional and higher-dimensional data (for example, order of dimensions might be critical)

==== Requirements Class Tiling

[[req_geozarr-tiling]]
[cols="1,4",width="90%"]
|===
2+|*Requirements Class* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}
2+|http://www.opengis.net/spec/GeoZarr/1.0/req/tiling {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|Target type | Gridded Dataset
|Dependency | TBD
|===


Tiling is a strategy for optimising chunking in GeoZarr. With tiling, access to a specific area or two-dimensional bounding box is much quicker, as the relevant data is stored closer together in the file, reducing the number of bytes that need to be read compared to the strips approach.

==== Requirements Class Pyramiding

Pyramiding is useful when the client wants to quickly render an image of the entire area or a large portion of the area represented in the file. Instead of downloading every pixel, the software can request a smaller, pre-created, lower-resolution version.

==== Requirements Class Map Rendering

TIP: in addition to traditional 2D formats, some conventions might be needed to faciltiate the rendering of time series or N-D arrays on map tools. For example, how the bands / layers of the array are referenced, etc.


==== Requirement

=== Referencing in STAC

TIP: might be useful to describe or provide extension for referencing GeoZarr assets (e.g. dataset) in STAC Items.

== Annex B: Mappings with other formats

TIP: Provides the mappings for information purpose to show how GEoZarr preserve information from any data source.

To ensure interoperability with most client and mapping tools, GeoZarr enforces a set of requirements, including conventions from CF and GDAL.

To maximize compatibility with various source formats, GeoZarr preserves as much metadata and structure as possible from these formats.

NOTE: In particular, if relevant information which cannot be encoded in GeoZarr is identified, the specification might be extended.


=== Mappings with CF

=== Mappings with GDAL
