==== Coordinate Types

TIP: Defines what are the requirement in GeoZarr related to latitude, longitude, time, etc. metadata such as does it impose to use CF standard names for qualifying the coordinate (or another convention from GDAL)

==== Geospatial Coordinate Encodings

There are multiple types of encoding for coordinates, each serving different purposes and applications in geospatial data processing. Some common examples include:

* Geospatial Control Points (labeled Coordinates) : each data point or grid cell is explicitly assigned a coordinate value, which can be used to directly map and reference spatial data. 
* Affine Transforms (Coordinate Origin and Step):  this involves defining a starting point (origin) and a regular interval (step) between points. This method is commonly used in grid-based data where the position of each cell is calculated based on its distance from the origin.

Proposed encoding:

- 2D array (the nominal encoding applied by xarray)
- origin/offset:
- COARDS :

===== Requirements Class Geospatial_Control_Points

Geospatial Control Points (GCPs), also known as Labeled Coordinates, are specific geographic locations with known coordinates. These points serve as reference markers to accurately align and georeference spatial data in mapping and GIS applications, ensuring that the data corresponds correctly to real-world locations.

To accurately represent the spatial dimensions of the dataset, each coordinate type origin offset must be defined in a child Zarr array within the dataset. This array must contain the triplet of values: origin, offset, and end, to describe the coordinate's range and intervals. Additionally, the coordinate variable must include a CF standard name in the `standard_name` attribute, specifically for latitude or longitude.

|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/req/geozarr-dataset/coordinate-variable
| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | A coordinate type origin offset should be represented in a child Zarr array of the dataset.
| B {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | The coordinate variable must define in the array the triplet of values: origin, offset, end.
| C {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | The coordinate variable must provide a standard name (CF) for latitude or longitude in the `standard_name` attribute.
|===

 To enhance clarity and interoperability, it is recommended that each coordinate variable link to the `grid_mapping` variable, which describes the CRS applicable to this coordinate.

|===

The coordinate variable should:
- Link to the `grid_mapping` variable defined to describe the CRS that applies to this coordinate.

==== Coordinates Reference System Encodings

TIP: any consideration with projections and affine transformations ?

|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/req/geozarr-dataset/data-variable-coordinates
| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | The coordinate reference system (CRS) must be indicated for each data variable (coverage).
| B {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | The CRS should be represented in a child Zarr array of the dataset (auxiliary variable).
| C {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | The CRS variable name should be referenced in the data variable (coverage) in the `grid_mapping` attribute.
| D {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | The CRS should be described in the attributes of the CRS variable using CF conventions properties.
|===

Each data variable (coverage) must:
- Indicate the coordinate reference system used.
- Reference the CRS variable name in the `grid_mapping` attribute.

The CRS should:
- Be represented in a child Zarr array of the dataset (auxiliary variable).
- Be described in the attributes of the CRS variable using CF conventions properties.

While it is recommended that all coverages in a dataset share the same set of coordinates and coordinate reference system to ensure consistency and ease of use, explicitly indicating the coordinate reference system for each data variable is necessary to avoid any ambiguity and to support interoperability when integrating data from diverse sources.

TBD explain the grid_mapping and required properties
